What is it?

The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.  It's open source, and enables interactive data science and scientific computing across over 40 programming languages.

The Jupyter Notebook, formerly IPython Notebook, is based on a set of open standards for interactive computing. Think HTML and CSS for interactive computing on the web. These open standards can be leveraged by third party developers to build customized applications with embedded interactive computing.  The Notebook Viewer uses IPython's nbconvert to export .ipynb files to HTML.

Main features of the web application
 - In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion / introspection.
 - The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.
 - Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.
 - In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.
 - The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.
 - There are four types of cells: code cells, markdown cells, raw cells and heading cells.
